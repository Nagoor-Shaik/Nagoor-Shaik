# Hey, I'm Nagoor Vali Shaik 👋

I'm not a typical developer. I started as a product designer — 
spending years obsessing over motion, interaction, and user experience 
in Figma. Then I realized the best products aren't just designed well, 
they're **built** well. So I made the switch.

Now I'm doing both.

I think like a designer and build like a developer. 
That means I don't just write APIs — I think about the person 
using the screen on the other end. I don't just design screens — 
I think about how they'll actually be built and scaled.

Currently I'm building **WePlay** — a sports slot booking app 
I designed entirely in Figma and am now bringing to life with 
React, Spring Boot, and MySQL. From wireframes to working product. 
That's the kind of engineer I'm becoming.

## 🚀 What I'm Building Right Now

### WePlay — Sports Slot Booking App
A full-stack app I designed in Figma and am building from scratch.
React frontend + Spring Boot backend + MySQL.
Because real learning means shipping real things.
