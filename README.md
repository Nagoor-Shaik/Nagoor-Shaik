# Hey, I'm Nagoor Vali Shaik 👋

Product Designer turned Full Stack Developer.

I spent years designing apps in Figma — motion, interaction, UX.
Then I decided to stop just designing them and start building them too.

Currently turning my best Figma concept into a real full-stack app —
**WePlay**, a sports slot booking platform built with React + Spring Boot + MySQL.
